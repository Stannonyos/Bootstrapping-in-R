# Bootstrapping-in-R
Bootstrapping resamples dataset to create many simulated samples. 
The technique is useful when you have a small sample size and you need to estimate a parameter, confidence interval or do predictions.
I have used a basic example to estimate the mean average price of a one bedroom house in Nairobi based on a sample size of 10.
With the sample size of 10, I have simulated 100,000 such houses and used this to estimate the mean price.
